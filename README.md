Webclient for Pok√©mon Online
============================

It connects to a relay station, which in turns connects to a PO server. If
you want multiple webclients to be able to connect to your server through
a relay station, you'd better add the relay station to the proxy servers
in your server config.

The host of the official PO relay station is ws://server.pokemon-online.eu:10508


Testing
=======

Thanks to github pages you can test the current repository with this url: http://po-devs.github.io/webclient/?server=default&autoconnect=true

Add the query parameter 'user' to automatically have your username set up, or 'server' to use a different server than PO's main server.
